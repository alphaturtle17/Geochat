# Geochat
Passion project starting in May 2025 as a way for Thor Long to create a fun, practical application for anyone to have a fun way of smartly interacting and sharing tips as to what is out there, in whatever environment they deem fun and necessary. 

To be used as a "Proximity communication system" and will utilize features such as:

* P2P communication services
    * Persons will write virtual "sticky notes" (call them something different) to communicate with people who are in that location in the future.
    * Establishes the backbone of the following features given relevant (and valid) information
* Alerts for emergency notification services
    * Significantly off an established trail for hikers
    * Bad weather
    * Recent dangerous wildlife/activity in the surrounding area (kinda like amber alerts but pro bono activity)
* Satellite conditions/imagery services
    * Trail conditions
    * Campsite conditions/locations
    * Weather patterns

## Lead Developer

Thor Long

## Technologies Used

* Jira: All process workflow will be tracked using Jira. This not only allows the project to be organized in a neat manner, but additionally allows me to learn how to use Jira, which a lot of companies use (instead of Trello) for their own purposes. 
* Expo: Expo, and React Native is a familiar tool that I'm able to use to eventually publish the app on IOS and Android. 
* Supabase: 3-in-1 database, user authentication, and storage for the app. Actively learning.
* Figma: Used to diagram out the app so I know what kind of design I want to move towards. 
* Stripe: Will eventually be used for monetization purposes. Likely, satellite features will need to be hidden behind a paywall, since there is a high chance that these services themselves require a price to pay.

## Startup Guide
