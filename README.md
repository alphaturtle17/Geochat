# Project Geochat
Passion project starting in May 2025 as a way for me to create a fun, practical application for outdoor enthusiasts to have a fun way of smartly interacting and sharing tips as to what is out there. 

To be used as a "Proximity communication system for outdoor enthusiasts" and will utilize features such as:

* P2P communication services
    * Persons will write virtual "sticky notes" (call them something different) to communicate with people who are in that location in the future.
    * Establishes the backbone of the following features given relevant (and valid) information
* Alerts for emergency notification services
    * Significantly off an established trail
    * Bad weather
    * Recent dangerous wildlife
* Satellite conditions/imagery services
    * Trail conditions
    * Campsite conditions/locations
    * Weather patterns
