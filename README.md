# Project Geochat
Passion project starting in May 2025 as a way for me to create a fun, practical application for anyone to have a fun way of smartly interacting and sharing tips as to what is out there, in whatever environment they deem fun and necessary. 

To be used as a "Proximity communication system" and will utilize features such as:

* P2P communication services
    * Persons will write virtual "sticky notes" (call them something different) to communicate with people who are in that location in the future.
    * Establishes the backbone of the following features given relevant (and valid) information
* Alerts for emergency notification services
    * Significantly off an established trail for hikers
    * Bad weather
    * Recent dangerous wildlife/activity in the surrounding area (kinda like amber alerts but pro bono activity)
* Satellite conditions/imagery services
    * Trail conditions
    * Campsite conditions/locations
    * Weather patterns
